# Multithreaded_Bankers_Algorithm
A multithreaded program that implements the banker's algorithm. And create n threads that request and release resources from the bank. The banker will grant the request only if it leaves the system in a safe state, also as it is important that shared data be safe from concurrent access. To ensure safe access to shared data, I can use mutex locks.
